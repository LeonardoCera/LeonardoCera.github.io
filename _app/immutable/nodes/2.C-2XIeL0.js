During my PhD, I developed novel single-assumption, single-conclusion proof systems in which logical terms can be introduced within the scope of other connectives. This research explored meaning-dependence between logical terms and investigated harmony in such systems. <a download="">(Download my thesis here.)</a> <br/> Following my PhD, I expanded this framework to bilateral, modal, and probabilistic extensions of PTS, broadening its expressive power and applicability. <br/> More recently, I have turned my attention to applying proof systems to model the behavior of machine learning (ML) systems, exploring how logical frameworks can enhance human understanding of AI. <br/><br/> <h1>Bio:</h1> I earned both my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Philosophy from the University of Pisa. In 2019, I was awarded a six-month research scholarship at the University of Pisa (PRA_2018_6 “Etica, scienza, democrazia”), where I investigated the limits and possibilities of pluralist approaches to logical disagreement. In 2020, I completed my PhD in Philosophy, jointly awarded by the Universities of Pisa and Florence, with a dissertation on Pluralism in Proof-Theoretic Semantics, supervised by Prof. Enrico Moriconi. <br/> Between 2020 and 2024, I worked as an assistant teacher at several high schools in Tuscany and conducted bibliographic research for the University of Pisa. In 2024, I held a postdoctoral position at the University of Rome Tor Vergata (Department of Literary, Philosophical, and Art History Studies) within the PRIN project PUMa: Proof and Understanding in Mathematics. Under the supervision of Prof. Gabriele Pulcini, I researched purity and simplicity in mathematical proofs. <br/> I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Milan’s Department of Philosophy, working under Prof. Giuseppe Primiero in the PRIN project SMARTEST: Simulation of Probabilistic Systems for the Age of the Digital Twin.</div></div>');function P(n){var e=g(),i=o(e),h=o(i);t(i);var a=s(i,2),l=s(o(a),2);p(14),t(a),t(e),d(()=>{r(h,"src",f),r(l,"href",v)}),m(n,e)}export{P as component};
