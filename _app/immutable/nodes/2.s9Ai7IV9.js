Then, I have obtained my PhD in philosophy at the Universities of Pisa and Florence in 2020, with a thesis on pluralism in proof-theoretic semantics, under the supervision of prof. Enrico Moriconi. <br/> In 2019, I received a six-month research scholarship to investigate "limits and possibilities of the pluralist approach in dealing with logical disagreement" at the University of Pisa, within the framework of PRA_2018_6 “Etica, scienza, democrazia”.  In 2021, I did a bibliographic research project on the same topic, still for the University of Pisa. Moreover, between 2020 and 2024, I have also served as an assistant teacher at local high schools. In 2024, I held a postdoctoral research position on “purity and simplicity of mathematical proofs” under the supervision of Prof. Gabriele Pulcini, at the Department of Literary, Philosophical and Art History Studies of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, within the PRIN project PUMa: Proof and Understanding in Mathematics. <br/> Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher under the supervision of Prof. Giuseppe Primiero at the Department of Philosophy of the University of Milan, within the PRIN project SMARTEST: Simulation of Probabilistic Systems for the Age of the Digital Twin.</div></div>`);function g(i){var e=m(),t=a(e);n(2),h(e),r(()=>l(t,"src",c)),s(i,e)}export{g as component};
